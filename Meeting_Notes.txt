==Friday, sept 30 ===

Have jobs that can be done by wednesday oct 5
Let’s have prototype by friday oct 7

Specific Jobs to do by wednesday
	Diana: 1st drafts for intro scene && 9/11
	Kara: concept art/pixel art drafts for moon landing; basic assets;
	Gabe: 9/11
	Pasha: Moon Landing
	Brandon:   So Brandon, we are thinking that the minigame the player would not specifically be tied to the conspiracy event, but it would just pop up in the background and happen to oversee. Would you prefer the player to just be random bystanders or the actual main character?  Leaning for going with the 2nd intro so I don't know how you want the story telling would be tied to this. Would be cool if you can make a quick edit ASAP for the story so I can start the intro scene and have some drafts finished in a few days  Also a quick character description of the kid too so we can work with that -Diana



I like the idea where the minigames are about bystanders doing whatever that “just happen” to have the backgrounds of the conspiracies happening

Minigames:
9/11:

Character can moves horizontally and tries there best to clean seamless
table until time is up. Random buttons that are hit on the table turns tv on.
		Assets:
Art:

PC Idle, run cycle [includes slide at beginning of turns], pouring coffee? [if so, must be very short {2-3 frames at most}]
